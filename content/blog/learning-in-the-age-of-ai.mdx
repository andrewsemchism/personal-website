Five years ago, when I began my computer science degree, building anything meant committing to a lot of upfront learning.

If I wanted to create even a simple website, I first had to understand the fundamentals of web development. Along the way, I read documentation, tutorials, and articles, absorbing far more information than I would actually end up using. Some concepts were directly relevant, others weren't, but all of it contributed to a deeper understanding.

To build the one thing I had in mind, I had to embark on a broader journey of learning many related things first.

That doesn't seem to hold true anymore.

Now, you can often get what you want without much upfront learning. AI tools can generate working code, which means you can ship something without fully understanding how it works. If you don't take the time to read through and question the code, you might solve the problem without learning much at all. And even if you do review it carefully, you're often just picking up the exact pieces needed in that moment, not building the deeper foundation that used to come from learning everything step by step.

I absolutely love the speed at which I can build things now. I love being able to build prototypes with tools I don’t fully understand. At the same time, I miss having a deep understanding of certain things. Especially now that I'm writing nearly 100% of my code with AI, it sometimes feels like I always know just enough to get by.

So here's my solution: small blog posts.

If I can understand a topic well enough to write a short post about it, that's a good start. My goal is to publish one small post each week on something I'm curious about or don't fully understand yet. The point isn't to write the most polished piece or to share a groundbreaking perspective. It's simply to keep a public technical journal and force myself to dig deeper instead of settling for "good enough."
